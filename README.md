# Wallpapers

Welcome to my wallpaper dump, well not really! Welcome to the land of horribly drawn and written wallpapers consisting of different linux distrobutions!
Hope you enjoy them.
You dont need to credit me, im doing this because its fun

Oh yeah, because these wallpapers are only in white and black, you can easily turn them into any colourscheme you wish. I wont be doing it, most likely. 
But it would be interesting if someone decides to fork this and do nord and other things like gruvbox
